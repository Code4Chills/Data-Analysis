Analysis of Black Friday Data

We collect data about sales made on black Friday.
We clean up the data and edit and drop some columns so that we're left with only relevant information for Analysis
We do feature engineering i.e Getting dummy variables for categorical data, splitting some columns so that the data is relevant and creating mathematical combinations of some columns for statistical analysis
